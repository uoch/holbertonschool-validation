Module 1: Introduction to DevOps: Automate Everything to Focus on What
Really Matters Prerequisites

Before starting with this module, it is recommended to have a basic
understanding of Git and GitHub, and familiarity with the command line
interface (CLI). Lifecycle

The following commands can be executed in the given order to manage the
Hugo website:

    build: Builds the website
    clean: Cleans up the build directory
    post: Creates a new blog post with the specified name and title
    help: Displays usage information about available commands

Steps

To use the Hugo website, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install Hugo and ensure that it is added to your PATH environment variable.
    In a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
    To build the website, run the make build command.
    To clean up the build directory, run the make clean command.
    To create a new blog post, run the make post POST_NAME=<post-name> POST_TITLE=<post-title> command, where <post-name> and <post-title> are the desired name and title for the new post, respectively.
    To display usage information about available commands, run the make help command.

Makefile

The Makefile provides the following targets:

    build: Builds the website
    clean: Cleans up the build directory
    post: Creates a new blog post with the specified name and title
    help: Displays usage information about available commands

Clean

The clean target removes the dist directory which is used for the output
files generated by Hugo. This command is useful if you want to start
fresh and rebuild everything from scratch.
